Branch Per Feature Git Work-flow
================================

For the branch per ticket work-flow you make zero changes to your master branch and make all changes on ticket branches.
You also have to maintain a committed revision (which you amend as you go) i.e. a single commit per branch.

This allows working on multiple tasks in parallel with clean separation of changes.
